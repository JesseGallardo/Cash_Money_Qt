Project Cash Money
---
This purpose of this project is familiarize myself with C++ and the Gui application Qt. The reason Qt was used because I
used it in a school project and was interested in using it again when I wanted to do a summer project. C++ was used
for the same reason as using Qt. Since I was familiar with Java, C++ wasn't too hard to use.

The project was built with Macs in mind and I'm not sure if can work on other UNIX systems like Linux without any problems due to the file management in the program.

The way the user would use this program is that they need to create a file first for the month and year of their choosing. After
that, the user will need to load the file after creation to begin adding items to it. The user will hit the "Finished" button once they are 
finished and the file will no longer be loaded so if they wish to change it, the user will need to load it again. The text
file format aims for simplicity and is strongly suggested that the user does not edit the file directly or else the program won't be able to work properly.
